<div class="title"><h3>Steps to make the pizza</h3></div>
<ol type="Step">
    <div class="steps"><li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the bread flour, olive oil, sugar, and sugar until smooth. Gradually add the bread flour mixture to the yeast mixture, stirring constantly until it forms a soft dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li></div>
    <div class="steps"><li>Once the dough has risen, remove the plastic wrap and let it cool slightly. Divide the dough into 16 equal-sized balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking. Cover each ball with a layer of bread flour, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for another 30 minutes.</li></div>
    <div class="steps"><li>Once the dough has doubled in size, punch down the sides of the balls to form a tight ball. Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise for another 15-20 minutes, or until it reaches your desired thickness.</li> </div>
    <div class="steps"><li>Preheat your oven to 450째F (230째C). In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the pepperoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy on both sides. Transfer the pepperoni to a plate and set aside.</li></div>
    <div class="steps"><li>In the same skillet, add the onions, green peppers, and black olives, stirring until softened. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned on both sides. Transfer the vegetables to a plate and set aside.</li></div>
    <div class="steps"><li>In a large bowl, whisk together the pizza sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni. Mix well to combine. Pour the pizza sauce mixture over the pizza, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Top with the vegetables and cheese, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.</li></div>
    <div class="steps"><li>Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown on top and the crust is golden brown on both sides. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing.</li></div>
